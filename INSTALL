You should know the drill by now:

1)   perl Makefile.PL

You might have to answer some questions during this phase.

If a previous version of Net::Ident is found on your system, the Makefile.PL
will ask you if you want to install this version in a backward-compatible
way. This might make it easier for existing scripts. See the Changes file
or the pod documentation for more information on what exactly changed.

If you want to force installing in a compatible way, add the "-c"
switch to the Makefile.PL command line.

If you have a mod_perl enabled apache server running on the current machine,
and you have an identd daemon installed, you are offered the option to add
a test that starts a separate apache process, in which some mod_perl tests
are performed.

If you are sure you have a mod_perl enabled apache somewhere, but it just
doesn't happen to be running right now, add the "-a" switch to the Makefile.PL
command line.

2)   make

Build it.

3)   make test

Test it. If you asked for a backward-compatible installation, it'll test
t/compat, otherwise this test will be skipped.

If you asked for the apache tests, the t/apache test will perform those,
otherwise this test will be skipped.

In other words: if you get skipped tests, do not worry about them.

If, however, you asked for the apache test, and the test is skipped, then
something is wrong with your apache setup, for example because apache
couldn't be started properly.

4)   make install

Installs the module.
