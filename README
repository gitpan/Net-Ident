NAME
    Net::Ident - lookup the username on the remote end of a TCP/IP
    connection

SYNOPSIS
     use Net::Ident;

     $username = SOCKET->ident_lookup($timeout);

     $username = Net::Ident::lookup(SOCKET, $timeout);
     
     $obj = Net::Ident->new(SOCKET, $timeout);
     $obj->query;
     $status = $obj->ready;
     $username = $obj->username;
     ($username, $opsys, $error) = $obj->username;
     $fh = $obj->getfh;
     $txt = $obj->geterror;

     use Net::Ident 'ident_lookup';

     $username = ident_lookup(SOCKET, $timeout);


OVERVIEW
    Net::Ident is a module that looks up the username on the remote side of
    a TCP/IP connection through the ident (auth/tap) protocol described in
    RFC1413 (which supersedes RFC931). Note that this requires the remote
    site to run a daemon (often called identd) to provide the requested
    information, so it is not always available for all TCP/IP connections.
