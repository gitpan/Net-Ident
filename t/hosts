# list of hosts on which we can test ident lookups
# also include hosts that don't run identd, but do run a regular "telnet"
# server, to test "connection refused" errors from the library.
# note that these tests actually rely on a common buglet in identd
# implementations, in that they let you perform an ident lookup on
# a connection that is incoming.
#
# Right now we know of no ident servers on the internet that serve out.
